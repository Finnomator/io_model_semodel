# io_model_semodel - SEModel Plugin for Blender (2.80) (DEPRECATED)

# NOTICE: SEModels are now DEPRECATED. Cast is the newly supported model format.

- Convert SEModels to Cast Losslessly [SECast](https://dtzxporter.com/tools/secast)
- Get cast plugins [Cast](https://github.com/dtzxporter/cast)
- "My Tool Doesn't Support Cast" - BEG THE DEVELOPER, CAST IS MUCH EASIER TO EXPORT! Or use the converter.
